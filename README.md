# Project Summary: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Alternative Data Question Answering

## Overview
This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance a question-answering bot's capabilities, particularly focusing on alternative data-related queries. By combining state-of-the-art tools and technologies, the system effectively provides accurate and context-relevant answers based on a database of research notes.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo**: Used for generating language model completions.
- **OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002**: Utilized to create vector embeddings of text data.
- **Pinecone**: Serves as the vector database where embeddings are stored and queried.
- **Langchain**: Provides the framework for interacting with OpenAI models and Pinecone database.
- **Python Libraries**: Various Python libraries such as `pandas`, `tiktoken`, and others are used for data manipulation and tokenization.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises a real company news dataset, where the research notes and headlines were generated using text completion algorithms provided by OpenAI. This rich dataset serves as the foundation for retrieving relevant information during the question-answering process.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Importation and Preparation**: The data is loaded into a `pandas` DataFrame and processed to extract relevant information, creating a clean set of documents.
2. **Tokenization and Cost Estimation**: Utilizes `tiktoken` to calculate the number of tokens in each document and estimate the costs associated with embedding generation.
3. **Index Creation on Pinecone**: An index is created in Pinecone to store the vector embeddings of the documents.
4. **Embedding Generation and Index Population**: Documents are converted into vector embeddings using OpenAI's model, which are then stored in the Pinecone index.
5. **Retrieval and Question Answering**: The system uses the populated index to retrieve relevant documents based on queries, which are then fed into the RAG setup to generate coherent and context-aware responses.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Retrieval**: By using vector embeddings, the system efficiently retrieves the most relevant documents for a given query.
- **Contextual Relevance**: The RAG framework ensures that the responses are not only accurate but also contextually relevant, providing a significant improvement over traditional question-answering systems.
- **Scalability**: The modular design of the system allows for easy scalability, accommodating larger datasets and more complex queries as needed.

## Conclusions
The project successfully demonstrates the application of retrieval-augmented generation in building an advanced question-answering system for alternative data. This setup showcases the potential of combining cutting-edge AI models and vector databases to enhance the capabilities of natural language processing applications.
